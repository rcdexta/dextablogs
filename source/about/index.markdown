Hello!

Welcome to my blog. I am RC. I'm from Chennai, India.

I work for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank">Thoughtworks</a> as a fullstack web engineer.

This blog is just a memory pensieve (yeah right, HP fan) of my coding escapades.

You can find me at [twitter](https://twitter.com/rcdexta), [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1385252/dexter), [github](https://github.com/rcdexta) and [delicious](http://delicious.com/rmchandru).

This blog is powered by the awesome [Octopress](http://octopress.org) engine and inspired by the [Villainy](https://github.com/drunkdev/villainy-octopress-theme) theme.

The tiny image you see at the top is a clever mashup of both dexters I love - the spectacled boy genius ala lovable serial killer. (Courtesy: [Loldwell](http://www.geekologie.com/2010/02/that-is-so-clever-dexterdexter.php)) and the blog name is inspired from them (after endless brainstorming in vain :P)

Have fun!

RC
